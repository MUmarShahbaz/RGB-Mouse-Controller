# Custom RGB Lighting System for Wireless Gaming Mouse

## Overview

This project is a custom RGB lighting system designed for a wireless gaming mouse. It utilizes a 4-pin common cathode RGB LED setup and an Arduino microcontroller to provide dynamic lighting effects. The system is controlled through a desktop application built with Visual Studio using WinForms.

### Key Features
- **Customizable RGB Lighting**: Users can configure their RGB settings using a desktop application.
- **Live Preview**: The desktop app offers a live preview of the colors as they are selected.
- **Persistent Settings**: RGB color configurations are stored in the Arduinoâ€™s EEPROM, allowing the settings to persist even after a reboot.
  
## Hardware Requirements
- **RGB LEDs**: 2 4-pin common cathode RGB LEDs.
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino (any compatible version).
- **Resistor**: 1 220 Ohms

- [Download](https://github.com/MUmarShahbaz/RGB-Mouse-Controller/releases/download/1.0/RGBC.Installer.exe)
- Connect the Arduino
- Use the provided controls to select RGB colors for your gaming mouse.
- A live preview will show the changes in real-time.
- Once satisfied with your configuration, click the **Save** button to store the settings in the EEPROM.
- The RGB settings are saved to the Arduino's EEPROM, which ensures that the colors remain even after rebooting the Arduino.
